ThingsPlugin for LockscreenInfo.

Connect to your iPhone/iPod with any (S)FTP client and copy the following directories to the specified locations:

- ThingsPlugin.bundle			-> /Library/LockInfo/Plugins/
- cx.ath.the-kenny.ThingsPlugin -> /Library/Themes/LockInfo.theme/Bundles/

If you have a working development environment on your mac you can build the plugin yourself. Just edit "IP" in the makefile to point to your device-ip and run "make deviceinstall".

After you've installed the plugin, you should select the appropriate list you want to display in the settings, and finally restart the springboard (or just reboot the device)
